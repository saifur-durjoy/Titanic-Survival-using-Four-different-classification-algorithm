# Titanic-Survival-using-Four-different-classification-algorithms

Applied 4 different classification algorithm to our model to deicde on the best model to use, those are:

## Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Neighbor Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier.

1. Also, used Cross validation on all the 4 Machine Learning Algorithm Models that we have used.
2. GridSearch on random forest and decision tree algorithm.
3. Applyied PCA transformation
